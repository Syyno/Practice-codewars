//Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals,
//saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

//I love you
//a little
//a lot
//passionately
//madly
//not at all
//When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

//Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals, where nb_petals > 0.
