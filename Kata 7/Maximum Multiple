//Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

//Conditions :
//N is divisible by divisor

//N is less than or equal to bound

//N is greater than 0.

//Notes
//The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positve values .
//It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .
