//Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

//You need to consider the following ratings:

//Terrible: tip 0%
//Poor: tip 5%
//Good: tip 10%
//Great: tip 15%
//Excellent: tip 20%
//The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:

//"Rating not recognised" in Javascript, Python and Ruby...
//...or null in Java
//...or -1 in C#
//Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.
